- ## Key Insights

- Younger employees are more likely to leave than older ones.
- Employees with fewer years at the company show higher attrition.
- Those in the **lowest income quartile** are significantly more likely to leave.
- A gender-based view of attrition shows slight variation, but isnâ€™t a strong driver on its own.

- Consider retention bonuses or learning/development incentives for early-career staff.
- Reassess compensation strategies for employees in lower salary brackets.
- Conduct stay interviews with at-risk groups to proactively reduce turnover.
